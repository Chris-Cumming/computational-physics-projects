## Bilinear Interpolation

### Overview

This project visualizes the bilinear interpolation of four corner values.

### Sample Output

### Details

This project contains a single file `bilinear_int.py`, which does the following things:

* Perform bilinear interpolation with four corner values and visualize using matplotlib's imshow

* Plot the zero line(s) by finding points that are "close enough" to zero and scatter plotting them (this feature does not look perfect, but is sufficient for our purposes)

### Testing

Download the project and run `bilinear_int.py`.

Change the corner values on line 4 to any floating point values to visualize their bilinear interpolation.
