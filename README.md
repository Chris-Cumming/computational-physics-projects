# Projects in Computational Physics

This is an ongoing project for me to investigate the field of computational and theoretical physics, including topics such as numerical programming and quantum computing.

Some of these projects are based on assignments from the Computer Simulation in Science course at Dalhousie University, which I took in Fall 2017.

## Motivation

My hope is gain a deeper understanding and bridge my knowledge gap between computer science and physics, my two areas of study in university.

## Goals

My goals include, but are not limited to, the investigation of the following topics:
* Methods and algorithms in numerical programming
    * Differentiation and integration
    * System of linear Equation
    * Ordinary Differential Equations
    * Partial Differential Equations
* Comparison of different Programming languages
    * Python
    * C
    * C++
    * Pascal
* Quantum computing
    * Numerical solution of Schroedinger equation

## Installing

To install, simply download the project as a zip file or clone the repository using the following Bash command:

```
git clone https://github.com/harveytwoface/CompPhysics.git
```
