# Projects in Computational Physics

This is an ongoing project for me to investigate the field of computational and theoretical physics, including topics such as numerical programming and quantum computing.

## Motivation

My hope is gain a deeper understanding and bridge my knowledge gap between computer science and physics, my two areas of study in university.

## Goals

My goals include, but are not limited to, the investigation of the following topics:
* Methods and algorithms in numerical programming
    * Differentiation and integration
    * System of linear Equation
    * Ordinary Differential Equations
    * Partial Differential Equations
* Comparison of different Programming languages
    * Python
    * C
    * C++
    * Pascal
* Quantum computing
    * Numerical solution of Schroedinger equation

Some of the projects here are based on assignments from the Computer Simulation in Science course at Dalhousie University, which I took in Fall 2017.

## Installing

To install, simply download the project as a zip file or clone the repository using the following Bash command:

```
git clone https://github.com/harveytwoface/CompPhysics.git
```
