## Evaluating Square Root

### Overview

This project explores numerical methods to evaluate the square root of a number without using existing math functions.

### Details

`sqrt.py` defines the function `sqrt()`, which takes in a value `x` and finds its square root recursively using Binary Search up to `accuracy`. It then compares the evaluated square root to the square root found using the Python `math` library.

### Testing

Download `sqrt.py` and simply change the `x` value to whatever you wish.
