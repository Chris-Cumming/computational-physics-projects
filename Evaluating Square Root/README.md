## Evaluating Square Root

### Purpose

This project explores numerical methods to evaluate the squre root of a number without using existing math function.

### Details

This project contains a single Python file that defines the function ```sqrt()```, which takes in a value x and finds its square root recursively using binary search up to ```accuracy```. It then compares the evaluated square root to the squre root found using the Python ```math``` library.

### Testing

Download ```sqrt.py``` and simply change the ```x``` value to whatever you wish.
